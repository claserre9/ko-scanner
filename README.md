# KnockoutJS Scanner
The project is a Chrome DevTools extension designed to work with Knockout.js applications.

It offers the following core functionality:

**Live Viewing of Knockout.js ViewModel Data and Context**

The extension enables live viewing of Knockout.js view model data and context directly in the Chrome DevTools. 

Once you select an element in the Elements Panel of DevTools, you can view the data and context associated with it in a sidebar pane titled "KnockoutJS Context".
This can be extremely helpful for debugging and provides real-time insights into your Knockout.js application as you interact with it in the browser.

Remember, this tool only works with applications that use Knockout.js for data binding.
